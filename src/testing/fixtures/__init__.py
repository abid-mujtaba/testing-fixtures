    Instances of this class function both as a context manager and a decorator.

    As a decorator they can be applied to test functions to act as a fixture which
    runs the setup, injects its yielded value into the test, and then runs the
    teardown.
    Instances are created from a generator function passed in which is the fixture
    definition generator.
    The fixture definition generator MUST be single-shot (single yield) otherwise a
    RuntimeError will be raised.

    The __enter__ and __exit__ have been copied from contextlib._GeneratorContextManager
    (the underlying class of contextlib.contextmanager) and then altered to make the
    context manager BOTH reentrant and reusable.

    The Fixture behaves similarly to contextlib.contextmanager with the
    important difference that the decorator does an injection of the yielded value
    rather than ignoring it completely.

    The fixture definition generator can expect args and kwargs.
    These are specified AFTER the Fixture object has been instantiated by calling the
    .set() method.

    Since a Fixture instance can be used by multiple tests AND composed with multiple
    other fixture definitions the definition args and kwargs are cached at
    various levels by mostly being closed over.
